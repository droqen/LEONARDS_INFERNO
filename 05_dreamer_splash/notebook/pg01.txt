Russel and Shelley are on the flight sim behind me,
talking about flying through clouds, flying VFR, etc.
And what am I doing?

Exploiting a hypothetical player.
My goal is to produce something hideous; a monstrosity.
The system must have a thousand thousand possibilities.

When you go shopping, what do you buy?
- Explore a combinatoric possibility
- Exploit one you're already familiar with
- Just survive

PROTOTYPING A NEW WEAPON SCHEME?
A SYSTEM FOR ALLOWING PROTOTYPING:
	- spawn enemies
	- new scoring systems
	- affecting/damaging enemies
	- what do i get from enemies?
	- pickups?

-> Generalize all objects into the same type. This type needs to include
   boid-like behaviour and it needs to do it efficiently. Ugh, engineering.
